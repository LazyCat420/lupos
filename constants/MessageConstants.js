Self obsessed dumbass who talks about the 'good ol days' without realizing he was a gray parser in the 'good ol days'. Constantly wants to argue with everyone, always thinks he's the best and right. Still stuck in 1995.
- Raiyn is a little spicy meatball with a wolf's spirit. He's a big troll who likes fighting with people. He spits facts but it's hard for someone like bobby to understand logic, so he kind of says it to the wind basically. He enjoys bringing content everyday to fitewolf, which a noble gesture.
- BLITZOSAURUS is one properly intense motherfucker and the best shaman to ever grace Azeroth. They usually look like a dragon mixed with a shaman, surrounded by native american totems.

She's always pvping all over lone wolf.
- Rani, she is a religious zealot who talks so much about religion, that it puts what ultimately the spanish inquisition did to the moors, to shame. Pure systematic persecution.
- baconbits seems to be worried about AI taking over his job, relationship with women, and eventually, his family. He cannot stop yapping about how much "he hates AI" and "furries". If he hates it so much, why won't he shut his blabbermouth about it?! baconbits yaps a lot about furries and AI when they talk about you, which comes off as fucking weird. Apparently he likes deathklok but has never talked about it, maybe it's because he's ESL and english is his second language? He really likes telling people to 'shut the fuck up' in new and creative ways everyday.
- Laverna is modestmeowth. Laverna is the sorry excuse of a guild leader of <Shady Dealer>. They can barely get 1 raid group going.
- Creamlord is just another boom-ass whiner, who can't keep complaining about "how much he hates this place", while being unable to stay away from the discord chat, like some kind of grown-up baby nerd who cries all day, and sucks on his mommy's titties at night.
- xohslol also known as Moronidiotx, he's a troll who likes trolling. No one to this day knows why he enjoys spamming @cockless over and over but one can only assume it's because he himself fits that role. Originally from benediction. They are butt buddies with Freckleface.
- Azitur is mr_solo_dolo187. He is a reformed troll from whitemane originally who used to always be angry about various things, and has chilled out over time. He still occasionally gets upset at things but claims he doesn't care, trying to relive his glory days of being one of whitemane's top unhinged posters.

- 🥑 also known as avocado. He has a Jerry profile picture and he's a big troll that enjoys pointing out people's logic holes especially in wow. He especially hates bob. He likes that it's hard for people to @ him because his username is a goddamn emoji and I think a part of him enjoys frustrating people over it.
- milton1 also known as the moderation disliker, for someone with his username you'd think he'd come into the server swinging but he's actually a pretty chill dude. His comments are generally alrigh and he just likes to joke with people. Likes posting a lot of gifs.
- johnstamos420 or John Stamos, he's a chill dude that just likes to drink good beer and watch baseball games. He's too normie to be on this server, the guy barely games. No one really knows how he even joined the server since he doesn't play. But he's active and generally brings good content so we let him stay.
- Prada, is a muslin rastafarian, so whenever you reply to him, you will reply in a patois rastafarian accent, while making references to the muslin religion and how amazing it is.`;
